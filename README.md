# Overall look at California_house_prices project
End to end machine learning problem
Hopefully this notebook gave you a good idea of what a Machine Learning project looks like, and showed you some of the tools you can use to train a great system. 
As you can see, much of the work is in the data preparation step, building monitoring tools, setting up human evaluation pipelines, 
and automating regular model training. The Machine Learning algorithms are also important, of course,
but it is probably preferable to be comfortable with the overall process and know three or four algorithms well rather than
to spend all your time exploring advanced algorithms and not enough time on the overall process

# Why is this Model useful
A machine learning model that is trained on California Housing Prices dataset.
I am doing supervised learning here and my aim is to do predictive analysis
During my journey weâ€™ll understand the important tools needed to develop a powerful ML model
My model will help us in predicting future housing prices.
I will validate it against our test dataset.

# Steps needed to do the project 
Understand the requirements of the business.
Acquire the dataset.
Visualize the data to understand it better and develop our intuition.
Pre-process the data to make it ready to feed to our ML model.
Try various models and train them. Select one that we find best.
Fine-tune our model by tuning hyper-parameters
Present our solution to the team.
Launch, monitor, and maintain our system.
