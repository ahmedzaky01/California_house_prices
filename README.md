End to end machine learning problem
Hopefully this notebook gave you a good idea of what a Machine Learning project looks like, and showed you some of the tools you can use to train a great system. 
As you can see, much of the work is in the data preparation step, building monitoring tools, setting up human evaluation pipelines, 
and automating regular model training. The Machine Learning algorithms are also important, of course,
but it is probably preferable to be comfortable with the overall process and know three or four algorithms well rather than
to spend all your time exploring advanced algorithms and not enough time on the overall process
